//ðŸ“Œ BFS of graphs
// Given a directed graph. The task is to do Breadth First Traversal of this graph starting from 0.
// Note: One can move from node u to node v only if there's an edge from u to v. Find the BFS traversal of the graph starting from the 0th vertex, from left to right according to the input graph. Also, you should only take nodes directly or indirectly connected from Node 0 in consideration.

           // When you popped the nodes,Then go to adj-list,checkout the currentNode is visited or not 
           // if current node (adjlist node) is visited alredy no need push into queue
           // if current node is not visited , we have to push into queue and mark visited for future calls
