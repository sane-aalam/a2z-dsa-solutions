// ðŸ“Œ Time and Space Complexity
// Time Complexity: The time complexity of this code is O(E), where E is the number of edges. This is because we iterate through each edge in the edge_list once, and for each edge, we perform constant-time operations (appending to adjacency lists).

// ðŸ“Œ Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. We store the adjacency information for each vertex in the adjacency_list, which requires space for V vertices and E edges.
